Description: Provides tools for semantic-aware evolutionary analyses of anatomical traits.
  It integrates semantic tools from rphenoscape and the whole-anatomy approach from PARAMO into a common framework for studying integrated anatomical traits.
  Current available capabilities include: setting structured Markov models for sets of characters based on a dependency matrix;
  recoding dependent traits as a single multistate character; building files to perform analyses on RevBayes or corHMM;
  visualizing dependency structure among characters with graphs and stochastic maps.
