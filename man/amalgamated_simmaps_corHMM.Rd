\title{A wrapper for corHMM that draws stochastic character maps given a corHMM fit.}
\usage{
amalgamated_simmaps_corHMM(fits, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fits}{A list produced by `amalgamated_fits_corHMM`}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to `corHMM::makeSimmap`}
}
\value{
A list of stochastic character maps for each character in the dataset
}
\description{
A wrapper for corHMM that draws stochastic character maps given a corHMM fit.
}
\details{
This function takes the models produced from `amalgamated_fits_corHMM` and
uses them to generate stochastic character maps.
